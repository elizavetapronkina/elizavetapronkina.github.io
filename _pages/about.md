Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M)](http://economics.uc3m.es). I am working under the supervision of Professor [Jesús M. Carro](http://www.eco.uc3m.es/~jcarro/). I am an applied microeconomist, and my research covers different topics, including Public, Gender, and Digital Economics.

I am on the 2020-2021 Job Market and am available for interviews.

**Job Market Paper [USSR, Education, Work History, Fertility Choices, and Later-Life Outcomes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q_1jp9ZOpznkIMF09WR_dy6CehgMO2nq/view?usp=sharing) (with Telmo Pérez-Izquierdo)**

[UC3M Working Papers - July 2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1msgCJf3HK6oeYdtBSnuMT7sSNLrn34os/view?usp=sharing)

This paper investigates how living under the USSR affected life decisions of East European individuals. We exploit retrospective data from the SHARELIFE survey and historical statistics to analyze respondents’ choices from 1950 to 1990. In particular, we compare individuals in Lithuania (former USSR) and Poland (former Soviet Bloc), exploiting both countries’ common history until the Second World War. We find that Lithuanian women increased educational attainment and accumulated two more years of work experience by age 50 relative to Polish women. These findings highlight the importance of country-specific factors when in determining the legacy of socialist policies. 

**Online Discrimination and (Self) Regulation: Evaluating Airbnb’s Nondiscrimination Policy (with Michelangelo Rossi)**

###### New version coming soon

This paper estimates the impact of Airbnb’s Nondiscrimination Policy in the US at the end of 2016. We identify users’ names using a machine learning algorithm and apply the difference-in-differences and event study techniques. The share of hosts who are not able to discriminate guests by rejecting their requests more than doubled from 2016 to 2018. Nevertheless, the proportion of guests with non-white names accepted by hosts who may discriminate guests did not significantly change after the policy.

**[Impact of Employment on Informal Caregiving to the Elderly Mothers in Europe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r_fxPrxUOWXf8LwRHq-PbQ0n30YD5QF1/view?usp=sharing)**

###### Previously circulated as “Caregiving to the Elderly and Employment Decisions”

This paper studies the trade-off faced by adult individuals in Europe between participating in the labor market and providing informal care to their elderly mothers. Using  Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), I develop a bivariate simultaneous choice model of work and informal care. To correct for the endogeneity of employment status in care decision, I exploit the heterogeneous impact of the Great Recession on European countries as an exclusion restriction in a non-linear setting. When individuals between 50 and below statutory retirement age participate in the labor market, the probability of providing informal care to elder mothers decreases by about nine percentage points.
