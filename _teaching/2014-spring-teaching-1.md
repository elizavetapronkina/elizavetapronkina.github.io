I received Teaching Excellence Awards in Microeconometrics, Game Theory,  Economics of Education, Mathematics II. In two courses, I was the principal lecturer and responsible for developing the course curriculum. I gave seminars and lectures, classes in computer laboratories. Moreover, I designed and graded home assignments, midterms, and exams as a part of my teaching duties in some courses.
